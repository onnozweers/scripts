A script that replaces hexadecimal characters (like in `md5sum`) with emojis for easier visual comparison.

---------

An automatic shutdown timer to limit the screen time of your kids.

Checks whether people are logged in to the system; if everyone is out, reboots the system.

Replaces a text block in a file. The text block to search for and the text block that is inserted as a replacement, are both in separate files.
