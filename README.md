A script that replaces hexadecimal characters (like in `md5sum`) with emoji's for easier visual comparison.

An automatic shutdown timer to limit the screen time of your kids.

The Duplicity that comes with Centos7 may not always be the best for the job. This script installes the latest greatest, including lots of dependencies.

Set up OpenVAS security scanner.

Checks whether people are logged in to the system; if everyone is out, reboots the system.

Replaces a text block in a file. The text block to search for and the text block that is inserted as a replacement, are both in separate files.
